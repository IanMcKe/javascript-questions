# This is where I'm going to keep track of coding questions I've been asked

## By Ian McKenney

##### Q1: Write a function that checks if a string is a substring of another string

##### Q2: Write a function that returns the first instance of a non consecutive letter (e.g. "aaaabbbbcccdeeee" returns "d")

##### Q3: Write a function that uses basic compression on a string so that it returns the number of characters followed by the character itself (e.g. "aaabbeeddc" returns "3a2b2e2d1c")

##### Q5: Write functions to build a binary search tree and check if it is a valid binary tree
